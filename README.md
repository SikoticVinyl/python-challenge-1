# Food Truck Ordering System

## Description

This project is a console-based food truck ordering system. The system allows users to order items from a menu, specify quantities, and then view a summary of their order including the total cost and quantity of items. 

- **Motivation**: The motivation for this project was to create a practical, real-world application of programming concepts.
- **Purpose**: This project was built to demonstrate the application of loops, conditionals, dictionaries, and user input handling in Python.
- **Problem Solved**: It simulates a food ordering process, making it easier to manage and summarize orders in a structured way.
- **Things Learned**: Through this project, I learned how to effectively use list comprehensions, manage dictionaries, format string outputs, and ensure user input validation in Python.

## Installation

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```
3. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python menu.py
   ```

## Usage

To use this food truck ordering system:

1. Run the script as described in the installation section.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to select menu categories and items.
3. Enter the desired quantity for each item.
4. After completing your order, the system will display a summary including the total price and quantity of items ordered.

## Features

- Interactive console-based user interface.
- Ability to order multiple items from different categories.
- Displays a summary of the order with total cost and quantity.

## Struggles and Lessons

During this project, I encountered several challenges and learned how to overcome them:

- **String Formatting and Alignment**: I learned how to properly format strings to ensure the alignment of the printed order summary. This included calculating spaces dynamically to keep columns aligned.
- **List Comprehension**: I learned how to use list comprehensions to efficiently calculate the total price and total quantity of items in the order.
- **Input Validation**: I implemented input validation to ensure that user inputs are correctly handled, including checking if inputs are digits and managing invalid options.
- **Using Dictionaries**: I effectively used dictionaries to store menu items and order details, enhancing my understanding of how to manage nested dictionaries.

By working through these challenges, I gained a deeper understanding of Python programming and improved my problem-solving skills.
